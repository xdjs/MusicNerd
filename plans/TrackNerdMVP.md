# ðŸŽ§ Music Nerd + Shazam MVP â€” Project Plan

## âœ… Overview

Build an iOS app under the Music Nerd brand that:
- Uses **ShazamKit** to identify music
- Uses **OpenAI** (via proxy) to generate deep-but-playful song and artist insights
- Stores recognized songs locally
- Has clean SwiftUI UI with Music Nerd branding
- Preps for TestFlight and eventual App Store release
